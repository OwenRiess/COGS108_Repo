These plots against probability of exceedance provide a greater understanding of how evapotranspiration and precipitation, which are both highly-influenced by weather, impact irrigation needs in the form of probability density.

They found that water permeates slowly in clay soils but is also retained for longer periods. Conversely, water permeates quickly in sandy soils but is retained for short periods. These two observations pointed to the need to water clay soils slowly, for more time, but less frequently, while sandy soils would be watered quickly, for less time, and more frequently. In the context of our project, this source provides useful high-level information on how soil type influences irrigation, but provides no relevant quantitative data.\n",
